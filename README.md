Home Doc is a health insight platform powered by AI (Llama3), designed to provide a Symptom Checker for quick, preliminary health assessments. Users can input their age, gender, and symptoms to receive personalized insights, with the reminder to consult a healthcare professional for definitive diagnoses.

This project began as a concept app during a hackathon, where I collaborated with two teammates. Although we couldn't complete it in time, I later took the initiative to finish the prototype independently. My primary role was implementing the AI functionality, but I also developed the frontend and backend, transforming it into a comprehensive personal project.

The backend might take some time to respond i.e. it might get sometime to send back the results due to the nature of the hosting platform. It should be snappy from the second request.
